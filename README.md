This is a Japanese learning mini-game where you make a little creature move forward with every correct guess. Every skip you use will cost you one heart. When you reach zero, your creature will restart at the first scene and your score will reset. For every correct guess, you earn some coins that you can use to give you a hint, but keep in mind you can only have one hint per question. Your high score and coins will stay in your browser's cache and are shared across game modes.

You can also use your hard-earned coins to buy some slightly faster creatures if you wish. I will add more in the future and make the selected creature persist in memory as well eventually. For those of you who wish to cheat, the word generated is logged onto the console :).
Also because the jmdict file is too large to uplaod directly, you will need to unzip it. 
If you encounter a CORS error, host the website via live server. I don't how to fix that error yet ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
